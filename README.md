- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @biotechlibrary
- My work revolves around using computer vision and machine learning to improve biological research. I am particularly interested in computational neuroscience, machine learning and computer vision. 
- You may contact me at pau.rotger8@gmail.com.
- Also, please do understand that my repositories are not representative of my code. My current role is in data engineering, which means I am building structures around sensitive information. 
- Here you can find some tools to aid the nuances of research.
