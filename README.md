# - ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @biotechlibrary

- My work revolves around using computer vision and machine learning to improve biological research. I am particularly interested in computational neuroscience, machine learning and computer vision. 
- **You may contact me at pau.rotger8@gmail.com.**

## Here you can find some tools for:

-research 

-computational biology

-neuroimaging 

-machine learning and possibly some computer vision. 

## One day I will have the bandwidth to create perfect documentation for my page, but until now, enjoy this informal introduction.
